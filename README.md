The goal of my application was to create a mobile app that allows the user to manage their inventory for their store from our app. It was necessary to have a log in screen and an inventory management screen for our users. My UI kept the user experience in mind by utilizing simple and effective layouts that are intuitive. I approached the coding for this app by using simple coding methods that were straightforward so we would not run into bugs later down the road. I tested my code by running tests for many different situations. I have some user authentication as well to stop people from injecting their own code into my project. I had to innovate with the UI to make sure that everything fit and was user friendly. I think I was succesful with my overall design because my app looks very nice.
